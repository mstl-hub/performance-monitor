## Errors and Corrections

### 2025-11-24, 14:30 - Documentation discussion

**Context:** "Why it has so smalle amount aof tokens?"

**Mistake 1:** "smalle" (incorrect spelling with extra 'e')  
**Correction:** "small"  
**Explanation:** The adjective "small" does not have an 'e' at the end. This is a simple spelling error.

**Mistake 2:** "aof" (typo - extra 'a')  
**Correction:** "of"  
**Explanation:** The preposition "of" does not have an 'a' before it. This appears to be a typing error where 'a' was accidentally pressed before 'of'.

**Context:** "Explain it please"  
**Mistake:** Missing comma in a polite request ("Explain it please")  
**Correction:** "Explain it, please."  
**Explanation:** In polite requests with "please" at the end, a comma is usually used before "please" to separate it as a parenthetical word.

**Context:** "Crete here little todo list"  
**Mistake:** "Crete here little todo list"  
**Correction:** "Create a small todo list here."  
**Explanation:** "Crete" is a misspelling of "create", and in natural English you should add an article ("a") and use "small" instead of "little" in this context.
